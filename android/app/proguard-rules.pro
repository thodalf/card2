# Add project specific ProGuard rules here.
# You can control the set of applied configuration files using the
# proguardFiles setting in build.gradle.

# For more details, see

# If your project uses WebView with JS, uncomment the following
# and specify the fully qualified class name to the JavaScript interface
# class:
#-keepclassmembers class fqcn.of.javascript.interface.for.webview {
#   public *;
#}

# Capacitor's native<->JS bridge calls plugin methods via reflection based on
# these annotations — without these rules R8 strips/renames them once
# minifyEnabled is on, breaking every plugin (push notifications, FCM,
# haptics, etc.) silently at runtime. Copied verbatim from
# node_modules/@capacitor/android/capacitor/proguard-rules.pro (the
# @capacitor/push-notifications and @capacitor-community/fcm packages ship no
# consumer-rules.pro of their own, so this general Plugin-subclass keep is
# what covers them too).
